# Save-my-memories
The completion of my “Save Store Website” project, created solely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This minimalist web application allows users to store and organize text entries securely. With a user-friendly interface, users can easily add, edit, and categorize textual content for efficient retrieval. I enjoyed implementing responsive design principles to ensure optimal usability across different devices.
